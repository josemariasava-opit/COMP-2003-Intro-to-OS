/*6. 
* Develop a C program that simulates basic disk I/O operations.
* Implement functions to read and write data to a simulated disk, where the disk is
* represented as a file in your program. Your program should manage basic operations like
* seeking to a specific position (track) in the file and performing read/write operations. You
* can create a file called virtual_disk.bin as a binary file to simulate a disk. Test your virtual
* disk by writing data to the disk and then reading data from the disk.
