* Write Write a C program that simulates basic file
* operations, emphasizing appending data to a file and sequential reading. The program
* should offer two functionalities:
* • Append data to a text file. When this option is selected, the program should prompt the
* user to enter the data to be appended. The program will then write this data to the end of
* ‘example.txt’.
* • Read data from a text file. When this option is selected, the program should read and
* display the contents of 'example.txt' from the beginning.
